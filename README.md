# List Value Analyzer

This Python script is designed to analyze a given list and calculate the total value of integers, the total value of floats, and concatenate any string elements in the list.

## Usage

1. Define your list `listt` with the values you want to analyze.

2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

3. The script will analyze the list and provide the following results:

   - Total value of integers in the list.
   - Total value of floats in the list.
   - Concatenated string containing non-numeric elements in the list.

4. The script will print the results to the terminal.

## Example

Suppose you have a list defined as follows:

```python
listt = [102, 6.6, '77', '564', 75, '3.92', 'E', 2.77, 7.66, 'C', '408', 605, '690', 'Z', '134', 'S', 'K', 148, '68', '654', 'U', '537', 0.64, 905, 5.75, 302, '7.57', '834', '0.64', '29', '709', '8.28', 'Y', 640, 'U', '0.92', 4.63, '259', '245', '5.1', 'Z', 'D', '5.58', 1.26, 6.95, '2.87', '9.25', 'F', 273, '852']
```

After running the script, it will provide the following results:

```
Total value of integers: 5225
Total value of floats: 57.04
Concatenated string: ECKSZKUYD
```
